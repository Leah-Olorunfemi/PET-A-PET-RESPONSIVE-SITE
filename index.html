                petting
                a doggy
                (dog) or a catty (cat) can help lower the risk of high blood pressure and ease loneliness and depression

                    class="petr-name"><strong> Sadie</strong></span> who got really sad and
                depressed after she lost
                her gran Helma in a tragic motor accident. How did her pet doggy Jeremy
                come
                to her
                rescue?

                Pls read her story below.üëá
            </p>

            <p class="m-5 life-story-section"><i>
                    "My granny Helma was the best and we were very close. I daresay I was a lot closer to her than my
                    mom.
                    We
                    went
                    on
                    vacations together, picnics together and in those moments ofinteraction, she taught me a lot about
                    life
                    and
                    I
                    loved and
                    respected her a lot. How devastated I was when she was killed by a drunk driver. For several
                    months,I
                    shut
                    myself
                    indoors and refused to see anyone. People soon learned to leave me alone. A year after Gran passed,
                    I
                    decided to
                    take a
                    walk around town, just to clear my head.I hadn't left the house in weeks. My legs took me past the
                    local
                    shelter
                    which I
                    had passed severally on countless occassions without as so much as a glance. But that day was
                    different.
                    My
                    steps were
                    slower as I relieved walking on those very roads with my Gran. As I neared the shelter, I could see
                    some
                    dogs
                    were about
                    to be transported into the shelter and that was where I first saw Jeremy.
                    He was standing among the other dogs in a small group but he wasn't yelping and barking like the
                    others
                    were.
                    Instead
                    his head was lowered and his ears drooped. I recall thinking to myself ,"maybe he didnt like being
                    in a
                    shelter". I had
                    meant to walk past, when he lifted his little head and focused his huge eyes directly on me. They
                    seemed
                    so
                    sad
                    and
                    lonely. I remmember wondering if he had lost his gran too or his mom. At that moment something
                    flicked
                    in my
                    heart. I
                    don't know what it was, but it made me retrace my steps and drew me steadily towards the shelter. I
                    asked
                    Karl,
                    who was
                    offloading the dog crates, if he belonged to anyone in particular."No one owns him yet but you'll be
                    welcome
                    to
                    have
                    him, if you would" , was his response. "I think I want to", I said. I followed Karl in for some
                    paperwork
                    and
                    checks and
                    the rest like they say, is history.</i>

                    Jeremy proved to be the healing balm I needed. Right from the
                    get go, he wrapped
                    his little
                    paws around
                    my hands and
                    looked so intensely at me, that I felt like, he was telling me, "You're my mom now". I guess
                    thers's
                    something about
                    grief that makes you more perceptive of the vulnerability of another and makes you more inclined
                    to
                    help. Jeremy has
                    been wonderful! I never knew pets could be so amazing. Gran didn't tell me that. Maybe she
                    didn't
                    like
                    animals but sure
                    wish she was here to share the happiness Jeremy brings me. He is a such an affectionate little
                    soul.
                    He's capable of
                    sensing my every mood and on those days, when I'm particularly low, he has this funny habit of
                    trying to
                    lick up my
                    tears,which tears me up and makes me laugh at the same time. Talk about using a 'wet hankie'üòä
                    It's been three amazing years since I met Jeremy and everyone says I finally seem to have gotten
                    over my
                    Gran. But
                    that's not true. There's no way, I could ever forget my beloved Helma ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π, whom I sorely miss
                    but
                    I'm
                    grateful Jeremy
                    came along to make it possible to keep living despite the pain."</i></p>
