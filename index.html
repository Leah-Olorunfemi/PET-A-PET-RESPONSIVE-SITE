    <p>PET-A-PET is a virtual hub for animal lovers from all over the world, who come together to share amazing stories
        of pet
        interactions and how having a pet has impacted their lives positively. Pets, be they birds, dogs, cats, horses
        or any
        other furry or not so furry friends can fill our lives with so much fun, excitement and joy. They are amazing
        souls who
        can cheer you up, make you laugh, get up to some mischief, help those with special needs and even provide
        security
        surveillance in some cases.

        At PET-A-PET we encourage everyone to make room for a pet in their lives. Research has shown that merely petting
        a doggy
        (dog) or a catty (cat) can help lower the risk of high blood pressure and ease loneliness and depression not to
        mention
        some social interactions that could not otherwise be had, if one didn't own a pet!

        Here on PET-A-PET, we like to call ourselves PETRS and this week we share the amazing story of PETR Sadie who
        got really
        sad and depressed after she lost her granny Helma in a tragic motor accident. How did her pet doggy Jeremy come
        to her
        rescue?

        Pls read her story.üëáüëá
        "My granny Helma was the best and we were very close. I daresay I was a lot closer to her than my mom. We went
        on
        vacations together, picnics together and in those moments ofinteraction, she taught me a lot about life and I
        loved and
        respected her a lot. How devastated I was when she was killed by a drunk driver. For several months,I shut
        myself
        indoors and refused to see anyone. People soon learned to leave me alone. A year after Gran passed, I decided to
        take a
        walk around town, just to clear my head.I hadn't left the house in weeks. My legs took me past the local shelter
        which I
        had passed severally on countless occassions without as so much as a glance. But that day was different. My
        steps were
        slower as I relieved walking on those very roads with my Gran. As I neared the shelter, I could see some dogs
        were about
        to be transported into the shelter and that was where I first saw Jeremy.
        He was standing among the other dogs in a small group but he wasn't yelping and barking like the others were.
        Instead
        his head was lowered and his ears drooped. I recall thinking to myself ,"maybe he didnt like being in a
        shelter". I had
        meant to walk past, when he lifted his little head and focused his huge eyes directly on me. They seemed so sad
        and
        lonely. I remmember wondering if he had lost his gran too or his mom. At that moment something flicked in my
        heart. I
        don't know what it was, but it made me retrace my steps and drew me steadily towards the shelter. I asked Karl,
        who was
        offloading the dog crates, if he belonged to anyone in particular."No one owns him yet but you'll be welcome to
        have
        him, if you would" , was his response. "I think I want to", I said. I followed Karl in for some paperwork and
        checks and
        the rest like they say, is history.

    <p>Jeremy proved to be the healing balm I needed. Right from the get go, he wrapped his little paws around my hands
        and
        looked so intensely at me, that I felt like, he was telling me, "You're my mom now". I guess thers's something
        about
        grief that makes you more perceptive of the vulnerability of another and makes you more inclined to help. Jeremy
        has
        been wonderful! I never knew pets could be so amazing. Gran didn't tell me that. Maybe she didn't like animals
        but sure
        wish she was here to share the happiness Jeremy brings me. He is a such an affectionate little soul. He's
        capable of
        sensing my every mood and on those days, when I'm particularly low, he has this funny habit of trying to lick up
        my
        tears,which tears me up and makes me laugh at the same time. Talk about using a 'wet hankie'üòä
        It's been three amazing years since I met Jeremy and everyone says I finally seem to have gotten over my Gran.
        But
        that's not true. There's no way, I could ever forget my beloved Helma ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π, whom I sorely miss but I'm grateful
        Jeremy
        came along to make it possible to keep living despite the pain."</p>
